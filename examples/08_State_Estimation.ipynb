    "Prognostics involves two key steps: 1) state estimation and 2) prediction. [State estimation](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/prog_algs_guide.html#prog-algs-guide:~:text=to%20toe%20prediction.-,State%20Estimation,-%23) is the process of estimating the current state of the system using sensor data and a prognostics model, and returns an estimate of the current state of the system with uncertainty. This estimate is then used by the predictor to perform prediction of future states and events. In this section, we describe state estimation and the tools within ProgPy to implement it. \n",

    "State estimation is the process of estimating the internal model state (`x`) using the inputs, outputs, and parameters of the system. This is necessary for cases where the model state isn't directly measurable (i.e. *hidden states*), or where there is sensor noise in state measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "ProgPy includes a number of [state estimators](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_algs/StateEstimator.html). The most common techniques include Kalman Filters and Particle Filters. Users can also define their own custom state estimators. Examples of each of these are presented below. "
