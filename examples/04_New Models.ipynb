Some elements (e.g. inputs, states, outputs, events keys; methods for initialization, dx/next_state, output, and event_state) are required. Models can be additionally configured with additional methods and parameters. "

For example, in the case of a thrown object, one could assume that throwing speed is a function of thrower height, with taller throwing height resulting in faster throwing speeds. When such derived parameters exist, they must be updated whenever the parameters they depend on are updated. In PrognosticsModels, this is achieved with the `derived_params` method. "
